# google chrome extension to show the total fee of airbnb trip

I was finding it very frustrating that the search results page shows 
the 'per night' room fee but doesn't include the various service fees
until I've clicked through individual room pages and want to book.

Until now.

With this google chrome extension, you will be able to see the total fee
of the trip including cleaning fee, service fee and etc.

## Install

Download the crx binary from [Releases](https://github.com/sekimura/airbnb-total-price/releases).
To install the extension, open the chrome://extensions page and drag and drop the `.crx` file from the Downloads.
